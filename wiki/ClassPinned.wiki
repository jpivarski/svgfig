#Draws an immutable object at given local coordinates

= class Pinned (not yet implemented)=

Pinned draws a given graphics object at a certain location (the "anchor point").  Only the anchor point of a Pinned object is affected by coordinate transformations.

== Arguments ==

*Pinned(x, y, d, basex, basey, attribute = value)*

|| x, y || _*required*_ || the anchor point ||
|| d || _*required*_ || an SVG object or graphics primitive ||
|| basex, basey || default=0,0 || internal position of the anchor point ||
|| attribute=value pairs || _keyword list_ || SVG attributes ||

The `basex` and `basey` parameters specify which point of the SVG object `d` should act as the pinning point.  When a `Pinned` object is converted to SVG, the tranformation `translate(x-basex,y-basey)` is prepended to the `transform` attribute of `d`.

Note that all lengths in 'd' are interpreted using global units (i.e. pixels).

== SVG method ==

Pinned has an *SVG* method, as described in [GeneralPrimative General features for all primitives].
