= class Curve =

Curve draws a Python callable as a path.  Curves are adaptively
sampled, meaning that the function is evaluated at more points near
corners and along curves and at fewer points along straight segments.
If the function is discontinuous (like a step function), the path will
be a broken line.

 == SVG method ==

 Like all grpahics primitives, Curves can be converted into [ClassSVG SVG] with the *SVG* method.
