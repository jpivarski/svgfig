#summary Draw a rectangle connecting two points
#labels Reference

= class Rect =

Rect draws a rectangle connecting two points, but the sides are
mutable by coordinate transformations.  If the coordinates curve, the
sides will curve.

== Arguments ==

*Rect(x1, y1, x2, y2, attribute=value)*

|| x1, y1 || _*required*_ || the starting point ||
|| x2, y2 || _*required*_ || the ending point ||
|| attribute=value pairs || _keyword list_ || SVG attributes ||

== SVG method ==

Rect has an *SVG* member, as described in [GeneralPrimative General features for all primatives].

== Path method ==

Rect has a *Path* member, as described in [GeneralPrimative General features for all primatives].

== Defaults ==

Rect has the same defaults as [ClassCurve Curve].  Defaults are described in [GeneralPrimative General features for all primatives].

|| random_sampling || True || if False, bisect with a point exactly halfway between pairs of points; if True, randomly choose a point between 30% and 70% ||
|| recursion_limit || 15 || number of subdivisions before giving up; if 15, sampling algorithm can visit _at most_ 2^15^ points ||
|| linearity_limit || 0.05 || maximum deviation (in SVG units) from a straight line ||
|| discontinuity_limit || 5 || minimum deviation (in SVG units) between points that is considered continuous ||
