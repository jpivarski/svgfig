SVGFig is a [http://www.python.org Python] extension module that defines two new classes, [ClassSVG SVG] (_svig_) and [ClassFig Fig] (_fig_).

[ClassSVG SVG] represents an image in [http://www.svg.org/ Scalable Vector Graphics] format, a markup language similar to HTML.  By making Scalable Vector Graphics commands accessible to the Python language, the [ClassSVG SVG] class broadens the user's capabilities in much the same way that dynamically-generated HTML did for webpages.  You can write programs that create images.

[ClassFig Fig] builds a mathematical figure by applying a coordinate transformation to graphics primatives.  Unlike the the strictly linear transformations in the Scalable Vector Graphics command-set, [ClassFig Fig] transformations can be any Python function.  Moreover, one often wants to transform only the mathematically-meaningful coordinates and not the widths of lines, lengths of tick marks, or radii of circular points, so [ClassFig Fig] allows you to make such a distinction.  [ClassFig Fig] transformations are composed by nesting, so you can make self-similar images by recursion.
