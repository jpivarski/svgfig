= class !LineGlobal =

!LineGlobal draws a line between two points, one or both of which is in
global coordinates.  (This line will not be curved by curving coordinate systems.)

This is useful for connecting parts of your figure defined in global
coordinates with parts defined in a coordinate transform.

== Arguments ==

*!LineGlobal(x1, y1, x2, y2, local1, local2, attribute=value)*

|| x1, y1 || _*required*_ || the starting point ||
|| x2, y2 || _*required*_ || the ending point ||
|| local1, local2 || _default_=False, False || if True, transform this point ||
|| attribute=value pairs || _keyword list_ || SVG attributes ||

If a coordinate is global, it can be expressed as a string with SVG
units, like "2 cm".

== SVG method ==

LineGlobal has an *SVG* member, as described in [GeneralPrimative General features for all primatives].

== Path method ==

LineGlobal has a *Path* member, as described in [GeneralPrimative General features for all primatives].
