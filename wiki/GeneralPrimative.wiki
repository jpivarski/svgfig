#summary General features of all graphics primatives
#labels Reference

All graphics primatives have the following features:

== SVG method ==

All grpahics primitives have a *SVG* method to convert to [ClassSVG SVG].

*SVG(trans)*

|| trans || _default_=None || a coordinate transformation function (to override the default) ||

== Member data ==

Every option in a primitive's constructor may be accessed later as member data.  For example,
{{{
>>> line = Line(x1=0, y1=0, x2=1, y2=1)
>>> line.x1
0
>>> line.y1 = 4
}}}

Some primitives define additional data members when they are drawn
with *SVG*.  For example, you can give [ClassXAxis XAxis] a vague
`ticks` specification and obtain the list of ticks actually created
through `last_ticks`.
{{{
>>> axis = XAxis(0, 100, 0, ticks=-10)
>>> axis.SVG()
<g (9 sub) />
>>> axis.last_ticks
{0.0: u'0', 100.0: u'100', 40.0: u'40', 80.0: u'80', 20.0: u'20', 60.0: u'60'}
}}}

== Defaults ==

All primitives have default SVG attributes which can be changed at the
class level or the instance level.

{{{
>>> LineAxis.defaults
{'stroke-width': '0.25pt'}
>>> lineaxis = LineAxis(0,0,1,1)
>>> lineaxis.attr
{'stroke-width': '0.25pt'}
}}}

Change the "stroke-width" for `lineaxis`.
{{{
>>> lineaxis.attr["stroke-width"] = "0.5pt"
>>> lineaxis.attr
{'stroke-width': '0.5pt'}
}}}

Make a new LineAxis; it has the old "stroke-width".
{{{
>>> lineaxis2 = LineAxis(0,0,1,1)
>>> lineaxis2.attr
{'stroke-width': '0.25pt'}
}}}

Change the "stroke-width" for all subsequent LineAxis instances.
{{{
>>> LineAxis.defaults["stroke-width"] = "0.5pt"
>>> lineaxis3 = LineAxis(0,0,1,1)
>>> lineaxis3.attr
{'stroke-width': '0.5pt'}
}}}

(But that didn't change the already-instantiated `lineaxis2`.
{{{
>>> lineaxis2.attr
{'stroke-width': '0.25pt'}
}}}

Some primitives have default options which are not SVG attributes.  They work the same way.
