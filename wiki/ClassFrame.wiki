= class Frame =

Acts like [ClassFig Fig], but draws a coordinate frame around the data.  You also need to supply plot ranges.

== Arguments ==

*Frame(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, obj, obj, obj..., keyword options...)*

|| xmin, xmax || _*required*_ || minimum and maximum x values (in the objs' coordinates) ||
|| ymin, ymax || _*required*_ || minimum and maximum y values (in the objs' coordinates) ||
|| obj || _optional list_ || drawing primitives ||
|| keyword options || _keyword list_ || options defined below ||

The drawing primitives must implement the *SVG* method, as described
in the [ClassFig Fig] documentation.

Unlike [ClassFig Fig], Frame has an implicit coordinate transformation:
from (xmin, xmax), (ymin, ymax) to its bounding box.  This coordinate
transformation (a [DefWindow window] transformation) flips the
direction of the y axis (SVG coordinates have y increasing downward,
local Frame coordinates have y increasing upward).

The following are keyword options, with their default values:

|| x, y || 20, 5 || upper-left corner of the Frame in SVG coordinates ||
|| width, height || 75, 80 || width and height of the Frame in SVG coordinates ||
|| flipx, flipy || False, True || flip the sign of the coordinate axis ||
|| minusInfinity || -1000 || if an axis is logarithmic and an object is plotted at 0 or a negative value, -1000 will be used as a stand-in for NaN ||
|| xtitle || None || if a string, label the x axis ||
|| xticks || -10 || request ticks according to the [TickSpecification standard tick specification] ||
|| xminiticks || True || request miniticks according to the [TickSpecification standard minitick specification] ||
|| xlabels || True || request tick labels according to the [TickSpecification standard tick label specification] ||
|| xlogbase || None || if a number, the axis and transformation are logarithmic with ticks at the given base (10 being the most common) ||
|| same for y || || ||
|| text_attr || {} || a dictionary of attributes for label text ||
|| axis_attr || {} || a dictionary of attributes for the axis lines ||

== Member data ==

These data may be changed at any time.  You do not need to make a list
of all graphics before creating a Frame; you can create an empty Frame and
append items to its `d` member.

|| d || list of plottable objects ||
|| all keyword options || same meaning as above ||

== Default values ==

Frame has several default values which affect the drawing output.
They may be set for a single Frame instance, affecting only that
object, or for the class itself, affecting all Frame objects created
for that time onward.

|| text_defaults || {"stroke":"none", "fill":"black", "font-size":5} || SVG attributes for the xtitle and ytitle ||
|| axis_defaults || {} || SVG attributes for the axis lines and ticks ||
|| tick_length || 1.5 || length of (one-sided) ticks along the inside of the frame (SVG units) ||
|| minitick_length || 0.75 || length of (one-sided) miniticks (SVG units) ||
|| text_xaxis_offset || 1. || distance between the x axis and the x labels (SVG units) ||
|| text_yaxis_offset || 2. || distance between the y axis and the y labels (SVG units) ||
|| text_xtitle_offset || 6. || distance between the x axis and the xtitle (SVG units) ||
|| text_ytitle_offset || 12. || distance between the y axis and the ytitle (SVG units) ||

== SVG method ==

Just like [ClassFig Fig], Frame has an *SVG* method to convert its objects into [ClassSVG SVG].

All graphics primitives must supply a *SVG* method with the same arguments.
