#summary Revision history: what was changed/added in each release

= Latest source =

[http://svgfig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ Source tree]

We have decided to simplify the structure of SVGFig in a way that is not backward compatible.  When this is ready, it will be called version 2.0.0.  Meanwhile, I will maintain the 1.x series with bug-fixes as they are discovered.  The source tree contains 2.x code in progress, and is not guaranteed to work.

Until we release 2.x, the wiki documentation will refer to 1.x behavior, which is different than the planned behavior for 2.x.

If you find issues that you think might be bugs, please inform me through the [http://code.google.com/p/svgfig/issues/list Issues tab].
