#labels Reference

= class Ellipse =

Ellipse draws ellipses and circles.  The shape may be non-elliptical
if passed through a non-linear coordinate transformation.

== Arguments ==

*Ellipse(x, y, ax, ay, b, attribute=value)*

|| x, y || _*required*_ || the center of the ellipse/circle ||
|| ax, ay || _*required*_ || a vector indicating the length and direction of the semimajor axis ||
|| b || _*required*_ || the length of the semiminor axis.  If equal to sqrt(ax^2^ + ay^2^), the ellipse is a circle ||
|| attribute=value pairs || _keyword list_ || SVG attributes ||

(If sqrt(ax^2^ + ay^2^) is less than b, then (ax,ay) is actually the semiminor axis.)

== SVG method ==

Curve has a *SVG* member, as described in [GeneralPrimative General features for all primatives].

== Path method ==

Curve has a *Path* member, as described in [GeneralPrimative General features for all primatives].
