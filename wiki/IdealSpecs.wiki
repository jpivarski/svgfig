#How I would like SVGFig to behave.

= Introduction =

I've been wracking my brain for the last several days, trying to figure out how to move SVGFig from its current state to a state where I would like to use it as my main drawing program.  This has proven surprisingly difficult:  there are things that SVGFig doesn't currently do well, but it's hard to figure out exactly what functionality needs to be implemented to make SVGFig work better.

Therefore, I thought I'd try a little experiment:  take some drawings that I've already done, and write out what I would consider the ideal pseudocode to specify the drawing.  I'll try to make the pseudocode as SVGFig-like as possible, but since this is primarily a creative exercise I'm not going to interrupt myself to look up the specs for existing functions.

This is a pretty simple one.  Here's how I would want to specify it:
{{{
P = Plot(-1, 4, -1, 4)   # Create the plot with axes.  I'm assuming that the shown axis
                         # style has previously been set as the default behavior
f1 = func('x + 1')
P += Curve(f1, color = red, thickness = 1.5)
P += Latex('x - y = -1', trans = 'x,y+6').rotate(atan(1)).placeat(0.8, f1(0.8))
f2 = func('9 - 3*x')
P += Curve(f2, color = blue, thickness = 1.5)
P += Latex('3x + y = 9', trans = 'x,y+6').rotate(-atan(3)).placeat(0.7, f2(0.7))
P += Dot(radius = 10, x = 2, y = 3)   # radius specified in pixels
P += Latex('(2, 3)', valign = center, halign = left, trans = 'x+10,y').placeat(2,3)
P.save()
}}}
