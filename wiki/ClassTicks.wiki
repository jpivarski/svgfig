= class Ticks =

Ticks is the superclass for everything that draws tickmarks.  By
itself, it can draw ticks along a curve which isn't itself drawn.
Maybe you'll find that useful.

== Arguments ==

*Ticks(f, low, high, ticks, miniticks, labels, logbase, arrow_start, arrow_end, text_attr, attribute=value)*

|| f || _*required*_ || parametric function along which ticks will be drawn; has the same format as the function used in [ClassCurve Curve] ||
|| low, high || _*required*_ || range of the independent variable ||
|| ticks || _default_=-10 || request ticks according to the [TickSpecification standard tick specification] ||
|| miniticks || _default_=True || request miniticks according to the [TickSpecification standard minitick specification] ||
|| labels || True || request tick labels according to the [TickSpecification standard tick label specification] ||
|| logbase || _default_=None || if a number, the axis is logarithmic with ticks at the given base (10 being the most common) ||
|| arrow_start || _default_=None || if a new string identifier, draw an arrow at the low-end of the axis, referenced by that identifier; if an SVG marker object, use that marker ||
|| arrow_end || _default_=None || if a new string identifier, draw an arrow at the high-end of the axis, referenced by that identifier; if an SVG marker object, use that marker ||
|| text_attr || _default_={} || SVG attributes for the text labels ||
|| attribute=value pairs || _keyword list_ || SVG attributes for the tick marks ||

== Defaults ==

Ticks has the following defaults, as described in [GeneralPrimative General features for all primatives].

|| text_defaults || {"stroke":"none", "fill":"black", "font-size":5} || default SVG attributes for text labels ||
|| tick_start || -1.5 || position relative to the axis (in SVG units) to start the ticks ||
|| tick_end || 1.5 || position relative to the axis (in SVG units) to end the ticks ||
|| minitick_start || -1.5 || position relative to the axis (in SVG units) to start the miniticks ||
|| minitick_end || 1.5 || position relative to the axis (in SVG units) to end the miniticks ||
|| text_start || 2.5 || position relative to the axis (in SVG units) to set text ||
|| text_angle || 0 || angle (in degrees) to rotate text ||

== Special data members ==

When a Ticks is evaluated with *SVG*, it will gain two members.

  * *last_ticks*: explicit dict of value, label pairs for major ticks
  * *last_miniticks*: explicit list of values for miniticks

== SVG method ==

Ticks has an *SVG* method, as described in [GeneralPrimative General features for all primatives].

== Other methods ==

Ticks has a number of other methods which are usually only used internally.

  * *interpret()*: evaluate and return optimal ticks and miniticks according to the [TickSpecification standard minitick specification]
  * *orient_tickmark(t, trans=None)*: return the position, normalized local x vector, normalized local y vector, and angle of a tick at position t
  * *compute_ticks(N, format)*: return less than -N or exactly N optimal linear ticks
  * *regular_miniticks(N)*: return exactly N linear ticks
  * *compute_miniticks(original_ticks)*: return optimal linear miniticks, given a set of ticks
  * *compute_logticks(base, N, format)*: return less than -N or exactly N optimal logarithmic ticks
  * *compute_logminiticks(base)*: return optimal logarithmic miniticks, given a set of ticks
